# Analysis-and-Design
In project one, I was asked to develop pseudocode that would allow for a system to output a menu for students to view their courses. Then, I was required to evaluate the run-time and memory of the data structures that were used to meet the requirements of the menu. I approached the problem by first breaking down the pseudocode into parts and developing it. This allowed me to easily evaluate the run-time and memory of each part of the psuedocode. This project was actually very interesting and allowed me to learn more about run-time and memory, which is very important to understand when working with data structures. 
In project two, I was required to develop the code itself to output a menu and allow students to load the data structure, view courses, search for a specific course, or exit the program. Since I already had the pseudocode from project one, it was simple just to transfer that into my code and have a working program. This project really opened my eyes to using binary search trees and allowed me to better understand how to write code for a BST. This will definitley be helpful in the future when I need to sort and store a data structure.
